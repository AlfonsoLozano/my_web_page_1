            <p>The sport of sailing involves a variety of competitive sailing formats that are sanctioned through various sailing federations
                 and yacht clubs. Racing disciplines include matches within a fleet of sailing craft, between a pair thereof or among teams. 
                 Additionally, there are specialized competitions that include setting speed records. Racing formats include both closed 
                 courses and point-to-point contests; they may be in sheltered waters, coast-wise or on the open ocean. Most competitions are 
                 held within defined classes or ratings that either entail one type of sailing craft to ensure a contest primarily of skill or
                rating the sailing craft to create classifications or handicaps.</p>
            <p>On the water, a sailing competition among multiple vessels is called a regatta. A Regatta consists of multiple individual races. 
                The boat crew that performs best in over the series of races is the overall winner. There is a broad variety of kinds of races and 
                sailboats used for racing from large yacht to dinghy racing. Much racing is done around buoys or similar marks in protected waters, 
                while some longer offshore races cross open water. Various kinds of boats are used for racing, including small dinghies, catamarans, 
                boats designed primarily for cruising, and purpose-built raceboats. The Racing Rules of Sailing govern the conduct of yacht racing, 
                windsurfing, kitesurfing, model boat racing, dinghy racing and virtually any other form of racing around a course with more than one 
                vessel while powered by the wind.</p>

            <h2>Disciplines</h2>
            <h3>Fleet racing</h3>
            <p>Fleet races can have anywhere from four boats to hundreds of boats in a race. A regatta must have at least three races to be counted. 
                Each boat's place in each race is added to compile a final score. The lowest scorer wins.</p>
            <h3>Match racing</h3>
            <p>In match racing only two boats compete against each other. The best known competition of this type is the America's Cup. The tactics 
                involved in match racing are different from those of other races, because the objective is merely to arrive at the finish line before 
                the opponent, which is not necessarily as fast as possible. The tactics involved at the start are also special.</p>
            <h3>Team racing</h3>
            <p>Team racing is most often between two teams of three boats each. It involves similar technique to match racing but has the added 
                dimension that it is the overall scoring of the race that matters. In three on three team racing, this means that the team that scores 
                ten or less points wins. For this reason, many tactics are used to advance teammates to make stable combinations for winning. 
                The stable combinations most commonly sought are "Play one", which is 1-2-anything, "Play two" or 2-3-4, and "Play 4", a 1-4-5 
                combination. These are generally regarded as the best setups to win and the hardest for the opposing team to play offense against.</p>

            <h2>Competitions</h2>
            <p>Until 1868, sailing competitions were governed by individual rules developed by each yacht club, which presented many 
                problems of arbitration and interpretation when several clubs wanted to compete against each other. On July 1, 1868, 
                a congress was convened under the auspices of the British "Royal Victoria Yacht Club" with the aim of creating rules that 
                could be accepted by all. In 1906, the decimal metric system was accepted in the measurement rules, and in 1907 an 
                international body was founded that regulates all sailing competitions. Today it is called the International Sailing 
                Federation (ISAF), and it is the body responsible for publishing the Sailing Racing Rules. The ISAF governs dinghy, Olympic 
                and cruising sailing, although some cruising races, in particular, use an international measurement system (IMS) regulated 
                by the Offshore Racing Council (ORC).</p>

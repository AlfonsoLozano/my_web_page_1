            <h2>Fundamentals of Computer Engineering</h2>
            <h3>Content</h3>
            <p>This subject is structured into two main parts: theoretical and practical.</p>
            <p>The theoretical section begins with an exploration of the historical background of Computer Engineering, 
                examining its evolution from the past to the present and projecting its future. It emphasizes Computer Engineering as 
                both an academic discipline and a professional field. Additionally, it covers the representation and organization of 
                information, introducing essential concepts such as number systems, data coding, and models. Contemporary topics like 
                Big Data, data protection, and the legal and ethical challenges of information management are also discussed. Furthermore, 
                the structure and functionality of computer systems are examined, including hardware, software, operating systems, and 
                networks. Modern paradigms and technologies such as cloud computing, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain,
                 IoT, robotics, and smart cities are explored, highlighting their interconnected roles in today's computing landscape.</p>
            <p>In the practical component, students gain experience in web development. They learn to create web pages using HTML5, 
                manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), and apply CSS3 for design and layout. These projects provide a hands-on approach to 
                applying theoretical knowledge in a practical setting</p>

# Design Detailed Document (DDD)

1. **Description**:
This project represents a summary of the skills and concepts learned over the semester in the Fundamentals of Computer Engineering course, focusing on HTML 
and CSS. The project relies on two primary files: index.html, which serves as the backbone of the website and organizes the structure and navigation and style.css, 
which contains all the styling elements that define the visual appearance of the site. It is a personal website that includes multiple sections covering various 
topics such as my academic journey, personal details, and a section dedicated to a hobby. 

 2. **Problems during the development**:  
At the beginning of the development process, I struggled to understand how the relationship between CSS and HTML worked. I wasnâ€™t sure how to properly link the 
style.css file to the index.html, which caused the styles not to load correctly on the page. It took some searching to realize that the <link> tag in the <head> 
section of the HTML file needed to specify the correct relative path to the CSS file. 

 3. **Conclusions**:  
This project has been a valuable learning experience allowing me to apply and strengthen my knowledge of HTML and CSS. Overcoming challenges, has improved my 
skills in web development. I now have a clearer understanding of building structured websites.
